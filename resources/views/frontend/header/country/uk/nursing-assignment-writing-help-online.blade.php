                                                <p>Most assignments in nursing are based on needs-pratients' need and aspects concerning nurse expertise and workload dispersal. Different assignments can, depending on the charge nurse or nurse manager, be made for equally distributing the load of responsibility as one of the care team members and adequate delivery of care. For students, these real-life practices in assigning work are not straightforward to understand. We would be delighted to focus our support on these very pragmatic issues concerning nursing to gain a better understanding of the thinking behind assignment allocation in the healthcare context.</p>
